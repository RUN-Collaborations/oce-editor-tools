## Features

  - Various underlying components assembled together and made available in an easy to use library.
  - These tools are organized in three packages, each one tailored to various use-cases, depending on your needs.

## Documentation

This project is organized as a mono-repository. The packages defined in this repo are published to `npm` individually. Here are the links and descriptions:

| Local Package | üì¶ NPM Package | Demo | ‚úèÔ∏è Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| [core](./packages/core) | [@oce-editor-tools/core](https://npmjs.com/@oce-editor-tools/core)  | [Core Styleguidist](https://oce-editor-tools-core.netlify.app/) | Various editor and preview components - the core library used by other packages|
| [pk](./packages/pk) | [@oce-editor-tools/pk](https://npmjs.com/@oce-editor-tools/pk)  | [Pk Styleguidist](https://oce-editor-tools-pk.netlify.app/) | Designed to make it easy to have access to various Proskomma functions |
| [simple](./packages/simple) | [@oce-editor-tools/simple](https://npmjs.com/@oce-editor-tools/simple)  | [Simple Styleguidist](https://simple-oce-editor-tools.netlify.app/) | A simplified implementation completely hiding Proskomma *(while also loosing some repository handling as a result of this)* |

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](./images/screenshot.png)


**Purpose**
- Multiple re-usable editor and preview components packaged into a library (monorepo). These are meant to be integrated into applications for editing scripture text in USFM format.

**Scope**

This package library contains various wrappers for other components. All parts are designed to hide underlying complexity and make it easy to use, as "tools". Just choose what tools to use from the most suitable package, depending on your use cases. 

These are some of the underlying components:

- the [XELAH](https://github.com/xelahjs/xelah) text editor. oce-editor-tools supplies additional UI parts, a toolbar, etc and XELAH supplies the text editor.

- [Epitelete-html](https://github.com/unfoldingWord/epitelete-html) HTML handling in Epitelete - as a derived sub-class. All the [original Epitelete](https://github.com/Proskomma/epitelete) parent functions are inherited and then extended with more functions for generating and parsing Html.

- [proskomma-core](https://github.com/Proskomma/proskomma-core) An implementation of the Proskomma Scripture Processing Model.
